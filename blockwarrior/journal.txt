calculating screen x and y coords
	player is always center of screen
	calculate position relative to player, then convert?
		get xdiff, ydiff
			May be negative
		multiply by scaling factor
		Adjust by screen offset of player sprite
		draw
Scenario
	Player coords are 20, 20
	Object coords are 25, 30
	Screen scaling factor is 2
	Screen width and height is 200
	Player coords is 100,100
	Object coords
		Diff
			xdiff is 5
			ydiff is 10
			Difference is object - player
			Positive difference means to the right or above
			Negative difference means to the left or below
		Introduce scaling factor
			scaled xdiff is 10
			scaled ydiff is 20
		Calculate coords relative to player
			Player coords + diff
			However, y is inverted, so y = player coords - diff
			x = 110
			y = 80
Coords test
	pygame.draw.circle(canvas, pygame.Color('#FFFFFF'), [50,50], 20, 0)
	circle appeared in top left of screen
